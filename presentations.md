# Presentations

You will prepare a short screencast (3-5 minutes) demonstrating your project,
which you will upload to YouTube/Vimeo. We'll watch all the presentations
together!

## Warnings

- **Do not put your video in your Github repository** or e-mail it to us, since
  it'll be at least 500MB.
- **Record a quick test video first.** Otherwise you'll end up with
  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCukspxmNDs).
- **Make sure your microphone is turned on.** See previous comment.

## Requirements

Your video must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo or a similar service. **Please do
not e-mail us your video or put it in a Github repository** since it will
probably be at least 500MB.

If you have a Gmail account, you already have a YouTube account. Just go to
https://www.youtube.com/dashboard.

### Technical Requirements

- Your voice, loud enough to be heard. Speak loudly and clearly when recording!
- A description and demo of your app
- A code sample explaining one thing you're proud of
- One thing you would do differently next time
- The next feature you would like to implement

### Other Requirements

- Be positive and upbeat!
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Move slowly when switching between different applications or tabs and narrate
  your process (i.e. "... and now, if we look at the code ..." _switches to VS
  Code_)

## Recording a Video

You may use any video-recording software you wish. Whichever you choose, we
recommend that you **make a quick test video first**.

Include a link to your video as an issue on the
[Project 2 Gallery repository](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2-gallery).

### QuickTime

QuickTime Player is in the Applications folder of your Mac. Notice that if you
go to the "File" menu you can create a "New Screen Recording"! This collects
audio as well. You can then save your video to your computer and upload it to
YouTube.

**Make sure you turn on the microphone before recording.**
